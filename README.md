# Weatheria - Real-time Weather App

![image](./src/assets/weather.JPG)

Weatheria is an app I developed using vite(react). It uses data from weatherBit api. Latest info is provided by this app about the current weather conditions.

**To View Weather Info about your city just enter your city name in the settings and click on -Get Weather Updates- Button**

Visit my App - [Weatheria](https://myweatheria.netlify.app/)

Technologies used:

- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- React
- Vite

This app uses the weatherbit api with 21 days free plan. If you have a better option (completely free) please inform me or contribute on this repo.

## How To Run The Project

- Fork the repo and clone it.
- Install dependencies using node(npm) or yarn.
  - To install dependencies use..
    `> npm install`(using npm) or
    `> yarn`(using yarn)
- Run it using ...
  `> npm run dev` (NPM) or
  `> yarn run dev` (YARN)

- The project will start on localhost:3000, You can now make changes to the project or contribute to it however you like.

- Using vite provided an advantage for mobile view as I was able to see it live while developing.

- To run a localhost on your mobile use...
  - `>npm run dev --host` or `>yarn run dev --host` and the terminal will show the below commands.
    - `➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/`
    - `➜  Network: http://10.104.218.56:5173/`
    - `➜  press h + enter to show help`
  - Now connect your mobile and laptop to a common wifi and search the network url *http://10.104.218.56:5173/* in your mobile browser to get localhost mobile view.
